##  Web Server with Login and Environmental Data Display


This project sets up a local Wi-Fi network using the ESP8266 module, operating entirely offline without internet access. Users can log in with a username and password to view temperature and humidity data collected from the AHT10 sensor. The data is displayed both on an LCD screen and through a web interface. The login credentials can be changed via a settings page. All configuration data is stored and retrieved using the internal SPIFFS file system.
